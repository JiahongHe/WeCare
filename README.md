# WeCare
WeCare focuses on designing a smart wearable device which can provide health monitoring, fall detection, environment monitoring and entertainment to senior citizens. The goal of the project is to protect seniors from potential dangers, give a warning to their children if the danger happens and also make their life more joyful. We believe this will become a true companion to seniors when there are living alone. The main challenges were deciding which features should we extract from senior movements to detect fall and the data transmission. We tried several sensors to get the best result. The final fall prediction accuracy is 97.9%, the environment monitoring is able to warn stairs and pitfalls successfully, health monitoring and chatbox are both fully functional. The goal is successfully accomplished.

The repository consists of code for fall detection, environment detection and chatbox. The language we use is mainly Python, a little bit Javascript for writing Lambda function on AWS and Java for Android App.
